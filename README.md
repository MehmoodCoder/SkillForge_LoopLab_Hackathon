# 📦 MERN Stack: Frontend Architecture Setup Guide

This documentation provides a step-by-step guide to setting up a production-ready **Frontend Workspace** for a MERN stack application using **React + Vite**. It covers project initialization, dependency configuration, and local setup—preparing the UI layer to seamlessly connect with an Express/Node.js backend.

## 1. Initialize Vite Project

Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm init vite
```

### During the prompt configuration, fill out the selections exactly like this:

Proceed? y

Project Name: name

Package Name: name

Select a framework: React

Select a variant: JavaScript

Select oxlintrc? Yes

Install with npm? Yes

---

### 💻 How to Run the frontend of the MERN Project Locally

If you want to pull this project and run it again locally, simply execute these commands:

```bash
# Navigate to the project folder
cd Project_dir

# create node_modules folder by running this command
npm i

# Start the local development server
npm run dev
```

---

## 2. Installing Core Dependencies for MERN Stack Backend

Run this command inside your project directory to install npm pakages in pakages.json file:

```bash
npm i @clerk/react
npm i react-router-dom
npm i @tailwindcss/vite
```

**It automatically Create package.json if not exists. Like**

```json
{
  "name": "client",
  "private": true,
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "type": "module",
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "vite build",
    "lint": "eslint .",
    "preview": "vite preview"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@clerk/react": "^6.14.3",
    "@tailwindcss/vite": "^4.3.3",
    "react": "^19.2.8",
    "react-dom": "^19.2.8",
    "react-router-dom": "^7.18.2",
    "tailwindcss": "^4.3.3"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@eslint/js": "^10.0.1",
    "@types/react": "^19.2.17",
    "@types/react-dom": "^19.2.3",
    "@vitejs/plugin-react": "^6.0.4",
    "eslint": "^10.8.0",
    "eslint-plugin-react-hooks": "^7.1.1",
    "eslint-plugin-react-refresh": "^0.5.3",
    "globals": "^17.7.0",
    "vite": "^8.2.0"
  }
}
```

};
```
